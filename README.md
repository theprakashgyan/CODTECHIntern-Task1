## Overview of the Project

### Project: DEPLOYING A WEB APPLICATION ON AWS

### Objective

The objective of this task is to learn and demonstrate the ability to deploy a simple web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS). This involves gaining practical experience with cloud deployment by setting up a server, configuring the web application, and ensuring it is accessible online. 

### Key Activities

-**Confuiguring Security and Access**: Configure any necessary firewalls or access controls to secure your application.

-**Testing and Monitoring**: Test the web application to ensure it is accessible and functioning correctly.

-**Deploying the Web Application**: Set the necessary file permissions and ensure the application is correctly configured to run on the server.

### Technology Used

-**Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: (A2C)For launching and managing virtual servers in the cloud.

-**Operating System**: Linux (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu): The operating system running on the EC2 instance.

-**Web Servers**: For launching and managing virtual servers in the cloud.

-**SSH (Secure Shell)**: For securely accessing and managing the EC2 instance remotely.

-**Security Technologies**: For managing inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instance.

-**Web Application Framework**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript as For frontend web development.

### Key Insights

1. **Understanding Cloud Infrastructure**:
   - Gained hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS, which is a critical skill for modern web development and deployment.

2. **Practical Knowledge of AWS Services**:
   - Learned to configure and utilize various AWS services like EC2 for hosting, IAM for security, and CloudWatch for monitoring, providing a comprehensive understanding of AWSâ€™s capabilities.

3. **Server Setup and Configuration**:
   - Developed skills in setting up and managing a server environment, including installing and configuring web servers like Apache or Nginx on a Linux-based EC2 instance.

4. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Applied essential security practices by configuring security groups, and firewalls, ensuring the deployed application is secure and accessible.

5. **Deployment Workflow**:
   - Understood the end-to-end process of deploying a web application, from setting up the server to making the application live on the internet, which is crucial for full-stack development.
